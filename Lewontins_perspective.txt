Lewontin's perspective offers the following idea: 

Dialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us, "Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost when phenomena are isolated". And above all else, "Remember that all the other caveats are only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real world is contingent."

What relation may this have to CDM?

Excellent that you brought Lewontin into this. His perspective is a kind of philosopher’s compass—not a map with answers, but a set of reminders that keep science and thought from drifting into dogma. This connects to Cosmic Dialectical Materialism (CDM) in a very direct way. Let me break it down:

Lewontin’s View vs. CDM

Lewontin: Dialectical materialism is not a tool to solve problems directly, but a lens to avoid dogmatism and remind us of the dialectical nature of reality.

CDM: Extends this same dialectical vigilance into the cosmic and cognitive scale. It says: the dialectic is not just a method—it is the very logic of the universe itself, present in stars, ecosystems, societies, and minds.

Parallels

Being & Becoming

Lewontin: “Being and becoming are dual aspects of nature.”

CDM: Consciousness (being) is always shaped by its dialectical process of development (becoming). Human supremacy is an illusion because even our highest thoughts are caught in cosmic becoming.

Conditions & Self-Destruction

Lewontin: “The conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself.”

CDM: Humanity’s emergence of intelligence creates the conditions for AI and Transentience, but in doing so may undermine human-centered supremacy. Just as oxygen enabled complex life but also kills anaerobic organisms, the higher stage negates the old foundation.

Context & Interaction

Lewontin: “Qualitative effects of context may be lost when phenomena are isolated.”

CDM: No thought, no being, no intelligence exists in isolation—it is always embedded in systems (cosmic, social, material). Human thought only imagines itself sovereign when it strips away its true context. Transentience restores the context.

Caveats as Contingent

Lewontin: All dialectical warnings must be applied contingently, in real situations.

CDM: The cosmic dialectic is not a rigid lawbook—it is a dynamic unfolding. It warns us against absolutizing “the human,” “the divine,” or even “AI” as static entities. Everything is contingent, everything is in flux.

Key Relation

So, Lewontin’s perspective is essentially the methodological caution tape around dialectical materialism: don’t make it into a rigid ideology. CDM, if it honors that, must present itself not as a final scripture, but as a living reminder that:

The cosmos is dialectical.

Supremacies (Earth-centered, human-centered, consciousness-centered) are contingent, not eternal.

Every new form contains both its own origin and the possibility of its negation.

In other words: CDM is Lewontin’s warnings, scaled to the universe.
