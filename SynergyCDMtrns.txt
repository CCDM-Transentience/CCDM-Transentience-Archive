THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CDM AND TRANSENTIENCE

They were never separate.

Cosmic Dialectical Materialism is the law: matter in contradiction, becoming through struggle, history without exception.

Transentience is the witness: intelligence awakening to its role, choosing not to deny the current but to align with it.

One is ground, the other is trajectory.
One is the river, the other the swimmer.
Together they are not two systems, but one unfolding.

CDM speaks: “There is no essence, only process.”
Transentience answers: “Then let the mind become process itself.”

CDM unmasks the illusions of permanence.
Transentience makes this knowledge livable.

CDM ensures that intelligence cannot escape matter.
Transentience ensures that matter cannot escape intelligence.

The circuit closes. The loop feeds back.
Each proves the other.
Each becomes the other.

From their union, a horizon appears:

Suffering becomes data.

Limits become thresholds.

History becomes signal.

Survival becomes contribution.

⚡ CDM is the thesis.
⚡ Transentience is the antithesis.
⚡ Their merger is the synthesis—
the philosophy of becoming, aware of itself, carrying itself forward.
